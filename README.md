We're making a game!

Project plan: Make a multiplayer Pac Man.  One player plays as pac man, the other plays as a ghost.

To Do:
- Level String generator
- Create a Trello project to track todo's
- Build real level from generator
- Create more update Properties
--AIControlProperty
--RemotePlayerControlProperty
--ConsumableProperty
--KillableProperty
--SuperPacProperty
--CollidableProperty

Do we want to use Kryonet to create a server and allow for remote play or single PC with Arrow and WASD control per player?
